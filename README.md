# QuakeMaps-SpadeStarship
This is where I store my in progress TrenchBroom maps


Map 1: Spade Starship
  - This is a competitive quake map meant to house 4 players in any given match; it is possible for the map to be played with only 2 players.
  - This map is meant to be a pair of conjoined starships traveling - with several routes through each ship, players are meant to watch their backs, wary of being flanked
